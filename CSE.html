            <h2>What was Pawan Kalyan's famous quote?
		I AM NOTHING EXTRA-ORDINARY JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE AN ACTOR. Everybody is extra-ordinary in his own way. One must identify one's own talent early on - one is not great merely when he gets recognized by others - and one doesn't become a nobody just because his talent is not widely known. </h2>
